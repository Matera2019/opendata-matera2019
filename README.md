# Matera2019 Open Data Platform

The [Matera 2019 Open Data Portal](http://opendata.matera-basilicata2019.it/) narrates what happened during 2019, laying the groundwork of future planning which, now more than ever, the community has been asked to work on.

At the centre of this platform, the data, now published in an open format. The Matera 2019 datasets are thus transformed into a digital commons that can inform, inspire and support new information and design practices for the local, national and international communities.
